# CRUD Todo App

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Todo application built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, EJS, and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Description

This project implements a basic todo list application where users can perform CRUD operations on their tasks. It allows users to add new tasks, view existing tasks, update tasks, and delete tasks. The application provides a clean and user-friendly interface for managing todo items efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js used to build web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing todo items.
- **EJS**: A simple templating language used for generating HTML markup.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application's frontend.

## How It Works

1. **Add Todo**: Users can add new todo items by entering the task in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.

2. **View Todo**: Existing todo items are displayed on the main page. Users can see their tasks listed with options to edit or delete each task.

3. **Update Todo**: Users can edit a todo item by clicking the "Edit" button next to the task, making changes in the input field that appears, and then clicking the "check" button.

4. **Delete Todo**: Users can delete a todo item by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task.
